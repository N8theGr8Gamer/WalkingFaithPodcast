            <p>
                Walking Faith is something I started to help get their spiritual lives on track. In this world we are all very distracted, and often lose sight of God's Word, and what we are supposed to follow. We get caught in the undertow of life, and just end up going with the flow. Here, I want to try to reinstill basic Biblically ideas in the minds of both new and existing believers, and also tackle the harder subjects as well, with no sugar-coating.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
        
            <p>
                My goal is to not only reach as many believers and non-believers, but to also manke a difference in their lives as well, and the whole world if possible. The Bible says that God gave us dominion over this world, and right now it seems as if we're letting sin have that dominion instead. We need to take back what God gave us, and be seriously about it as well. We should call out the sin in our world, I want to try to get as many people as possible to do this with me. There's a saying that I can't say enough; "It is better to stand with God and be judged by the world than it is to stand with the world and be judged by God".

            <p>
                I try to make episodes on these different topics as I'm able, and you can fine these on Spotify, Youtube, and Google and Apple Podcasts! Whether or not I will include other people is yet to be determined, howver I have a discord server in the works, where you can chat, make friends, and make suggestions! Click below to visit the podcast!
